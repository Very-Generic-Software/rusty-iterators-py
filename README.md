# Rusty iterators

Have you ever worked with a script in `Python` and wondered, why you can't have fast, light, lazy and easy-to-use iterators just like in `Rust`? Don't worry, we've got you covered - `rusty-iterators` bring the same interface to `Python`! And all of that without taking any shortcuts:

- Thanks to `Cython`, the performance is comparable with `itertools` and `stdlib`, but with friendly functional programming syntax!
- No production dependencies!
- Full support for modern static typing, compatible with `Python >= 3.10`!
- Basic support for async programming, with even more to come!

Project heavily inspired by great `Rust` iterators and crates like `Rayon` and `Itertools`. Make sure to check them out as well!

## ðŸ›  Local build and installation

To create a distributable package (`.whl`):

```bash
poetry build
```

this will generate the `C` code from cython files, compile them into the `.so` libraries and build the final package with type stubs. A new `dist/` directory will appear in the project root, where your distributable will be stored.

To install the built package for local testing:

```bash
pip3 install dist/rusty_iterators-<your-build-version>.whl
```

You can also setup the installation in your local virtual environment, by running:

```bash
poetry install
```

this will build your package and automatically install it into the environment.

## Coding code of conduct

Any contributions are welcome, but please adhere to our code of conduct.

#### Conventional Commits

We utilize [conventional commits](https://gist.github.com/qoomon/5dfcdf8eec66a051ecd85625518cfd13). We don't maintain a `changelog` manually. Squashed commits, keeping the correct convention should be more than enough to create a release summary.

#### Static typing

We are huge advocates of statically typed Python and put a lot of effort into keeping the types as clean as possible. We also maintain the types static tests located in the `tests/types/` directory. All of the contributed code should be properly typed and make changes in the type stubs if needed. To run the static types tests, simply run:

```bash
poetry run poe mypy
```

#### Tests

We maintain a simple testing pipeline, trying to keep all of the shipped features fully tested. All of the bugfixes and features should ship with proper tests. To run the testing pipeline, simply run:

```bash
poetry run poe test
```

## Examples

Project is still in development and we don't have any proper documentation, so for now you can check out some very simple examples. More complex code can be found in the `examples/` directory.

#### Count all even numbers in the iterator

```python
from rusty_iterators import LIter

result = LIter.from_items(1, 2, 3, 4).filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0).count()
```

#### Check if iterator is incremental

```python
from rusty_iterators import LIter

result = (
        LIter.from_items(1, 2, 4, 3)
        .moving_window(2)
        .map(lambda pair: pair[0] <= pair[1])
        .all()
)
```

#### Iterate with indices over all even numbers in the iterator

```python
from rusty_iterators import LIter

it = LIter.from_items(1, 2, 3, 4).filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0).enumerate()

for idx, value in it:
        print(idx, value)
```

#### Get `n` items from cycle iterator

```python
from rusty_iterators import LIter

result = (
        LIter.from_items(1, 2, 3, 4)
        .map(lambda x: x**2)
        .cycle()
        .take(30)
        .collect()
)
```

#### Parse file line by line

```python
from rusty_iterators import LIter

with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    result = (
        LIter.from_it(file)
        .map(lambda l: LIter.from_seq(l).filter(lambda c: c.isnumeric()).map(lambda c: int(c)).collect())
        .collect()
    )
```

#### Dispatch asyncio tasks and wait for their execution

```python
async def fetch_data(url: str) -> Optional[bytes]:
        # Some blocking api call.
        ...

async def wait_for_task[T](task: asyncio.Task[T]) -> T:
        return await task

tasks = (
    LIter.from_items(1, 2, 3)
    .map(lambda num: f"https://mywebsite/api/items/{num}")
    .map(lambda url: fetch_data(url))
    .map(lambda crt: asyncio.create_task(crt))
    .collect_into(tuple)
)

results = await LIter.from_seq(tasks).as_async().amap(wait_for_task).acollect()
```
